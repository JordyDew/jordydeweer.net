Now, it is time for a first project. As you may know, I'm visually impaired and sometimes, it is hard to take notes. I want to build a simple note taking application and I will share the process in my blog with you.

This post will not contain any code, but it will explain the purpose of the application, as well as how I will implement everything and how I see certain parts of it.

## The app: an overview.
