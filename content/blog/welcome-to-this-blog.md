In this blog, I’ll write about my adventures, findings and issues with or about the entire .NET stack. That’ll range from ASP.NET Core to cutting-edge technologies like Blazor and MAUI.

I code from a day to day basis. In this blog, I want to tell about the adventures I had, the findings I made and the issues I encountered during my ever-lasting development/learning journey. You’ll mostly see .NET related stuff pass by, but it could happen that I write an occasional post about some other technique or technology I tried out too.

## About myself
I’m a freelance .NET developer based in Belgium. I love to share my knowledge and teach others what I can. From that, I decided to start writing a blog about development tasks and stuff.

Besides a code writer, I’m a musician- I play the accordion. I also love being with friends and playing with my dog.

If you want to know more about me, head over to the page [about me](/page/about/).

Well, that was it for now. Regularly visit this blog as new content might come online any moment!
