> The fact that I am blind is not what defines my life.<br />
> – Andrea Bocelli

This quote goes for me as much as for him. I’m blind and though I am a freelance developer. I started learning when I was eleven years old and still am self-teaching myself new things day after day. I even quit school to be a developer.

## My life in code
When I was an 8-year-old boy, I had to learn how to use the computer so that I would be able to follow classes in a mostly normal way. Soon after I started taking computer lessons, I was able to teach my teacher new stuff.

And that’s where it all started: my interest for computers was born. Of course as a kid, you don’t know everything you need to know, so I made horrible mistakes, covered up, made other mistakes. And this way, I learned how to operate a computer very well.

At the age of eleven, I got interested in how websites were made. And what do you do when you want to know something? Right, google it.

I quickly came across websites like webly, and software like Joomla. But I reconned there had to be more to the story. I dug deeper and found out about HTML. In two weeks I mastered HTML and I moved on to CSS.

CSS didn’t deserve that much attention, as my blindness made it hard to do. So, I moved on. JavaScript you think? No, I didn’t lake it then and even hate it by now.

No, I started learning PHP. Back in 2012-2013 that was a widely-used scripting language on the web (and it still is). I taught myself using tutorials, free (hand)books, code snippets and alike. I had used PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter, Symfony and Laravel. Then I decided to take another language to learn.

I picked Python as it was (and still is) supposed to be very human-readable and cross platform. I learned about CLI a lot, but also about other web technologies like Django and Flask.

It wasn’t until 2017 that I discovered the .NET Framework. I started playing around with WinForms a bit and found it nice. C# was’nt a problem at all: I had by then enough coding experience to grab techniques from PHP and Python to compose a solid understanding about the C# principles.

In 2018 I quit high school to begin studying a software degree. They used .NET (Core) there and it was in college I learned about ASP.NET Core. However, I started to learn much faster than the others, causing continuous boredom in class. Hence that’s why I’m here: no degrees but a very solid software development knowledge in .NET.

## I surely also have hobbies
As you read the previous section, you probably started thinking of me as the stereotypical nerd/geek. You could place me into that category, I agree, but I also do other stuff.

I play the accordion since 2016, mastering tha tpretty good as well. I love a good book and could binge-read a book or series at once.

Family and friends are important to me, so I like being with them. A more comfortable, quiet, calm environment carries my preference, so you could find me with friends in a coffee shop or a cozy café  .
